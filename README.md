Implementing this script in a custom scenario is easy peasy.

Step 1: Download AI_chatbot_v2 as a zip/rar file. Place it somewhere you can find it for later.
Step 2: Click 'edit 'on a scenario you want to install this script in.
Step 3: Scroll all the way down and click on 'Scripts'. Don't worry about the programming stuff.
Step 4: On the top right hand side of the screen, click on the icon with the up arrow.
Step 5: Find AI_chatbot_v2.rar. Click on it, upload it.
Step 6: Top right hand side of the screen again, click on the floppy disk icon (or the thing that looks vaguely like a Nintendo DS). This should save the script to the scenario.
Step 7: Done.
